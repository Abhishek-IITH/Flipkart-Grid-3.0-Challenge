# Flipkart-Grid-3.0-Challenge
Autonomous Navigation Project (Team of 14 members in IITH)
Project outline:
Problem statement : Autonomous Navigation of warehouse robots without any on-board sensors. 
Solution used:
      1. Built 4 UGV bots for navigating across a predefined path in a relay fashion.
      2. Used A* algorithm for path detection and Stanley control logic for path tracking.
      3. Developed a central navigation system using a central phone camera for initial bot detection and constraint estimation.
